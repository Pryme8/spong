# TODO List Management

## Location
The project maintains a master TODO list at: `TODO.md` (root directory)

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Check TODO List
When starting a task, **ALWAYS** read `TODO.md` to see if your work relates to any existing TODO items.

### 2. Mark Completed Items
**CRITICAL: You must ALWAYS get explicit human confirmation before marking any item as complete.**

Before marking a TODO item as complete:
- Ask the user to confirm the task is complete and ready to be marked off
- Wait for explicit approval (e.g., "yes", "mark it complete", "ok")
- DO NOT mark items complete without this confirmation, even if you believe the work is done

Once confirmed by the user:
- Move it from "Current Tasks" to "Completed Tasks" section
- Apply strikethrough formatting: `- [x] ~~Task description~~`
- Add a brief note if helpful: `- [x] ~~Task~~ (Completed: brief note)`

### 3. Add New TODOs
As you work, you may discover:
- Related tasks that should be done
- Technical debt to address
- Follow-up work needed
- Dependencies or blockers

**Add these to the TODO list immediately** under "Current Tasks"

### 4. Keep It Organized
- Use clear, actionable descriptions
- Break large tasks into smaller items
- Group related tasks together
- Use checkboxes: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete

## Example Updates

```markdown
## Current Tasks
- [ ] New task discovered during implementation
- [ ] Another follow-up task

## Completed Tasks
- [x] ~~Enable build system in game cycle~~ (Completed: integrated into GameView.vue)
```

## Format Rules
- Use markdown checkboxes for all tasks
- Keep descriptions concise but clear
- Include technical details when relevant
- Update the list in the same commit as the related work
